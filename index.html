        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tanner Rickman, I grew up in a small town in rural Missouri, after high school I attended the Missouri State University and decided to pursue a degree in Finance.
            After nearly completing my degree I took a look at what I was doing with my life and decided it was not the career path that was meant for me, I wasn't passionate and I wasn't happy.
            My entire life I have loved video games and devoted a good portion of my life to playing them, so I decided to do a 180 and follow my heart. I learned how to program online through a bootcamp as well as trial and error on my own.
            Learning to program has shown me that I can do something I love with my life and enjoy the work I do. Hopefully this career will lead me to one day being a part of a team to make the video games that have given me so many good memories.
        </p>
